# mern-stack-learning-journey
A comprehensive repository for learning full-stack web development using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack. This repository will serve as a centralized hub for code examples, projects, notes, and resources related to MERN stack development.


# My JavaScript Learning Journey ðŸš€  

I created a series of simple yet functional JavaScript projects to refresh my learning and build foundational skills. These projects demonstrate practical implementations of core JavaScript concepts, DOM manipulation, API integration, and more. Check them out below:  

### Projects  

1. **[To-Do App (Local Storage)](https://wayiam.github.io/mern-stack-learning-journey/JS_Projects/01_todoAppInLocalStorage/)**  
   - A classic to-do app that stores data in the browser's local storage, ensuring persistence across sessions.  

2. **[Weather App](https://wayiam.github.io/mern-stack-learning-journey/JS_Projects/02_weatherApp/)**  
   - Fetches real-time weather data using an API, displaying temperature, humidity, and more.  

3. **[E-commerce App](https://wayiam.github.io/mern-stack-learning-journey/JS_Projects/03_ecommerce/)**  
   - A basic e-commerce prototype showcasing product listings and a functional shopping cart.  

4. **[Expense Tracker](https://wayiam.github.io/mern-stack-learning-journey/JS_Projects/04_expense_tracker/)**  
   - Tracks income and expenses, dynamically updating the balance.  

5. **[Quiz App](https://wayiam.github.io/mern-stack-learning-journey/JS_Projects/05_quizApp/)**  
   - A quiz application with dynamic question rendering and score calculation.  

### Why These Projects?  
- To refresh core JavaScript skills.
- To explore practical applications of DOM manipulation.
- To practice API integration and local storage usage.

Feel free to explore and suggest improvements!
